1. Project Specification

General Objective:
The goal of our team is to construct a Mini Game Arcade utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The arcade will have 2â€“3 classic browser-based games that are interactive, aesthetically pleasing, and responsive.


Deliverables / Expectations:

i. Landing page where users can access all included games.
ii. At least two games created (i.e., Rock Paper Scissors, Tic Tac Toe, or Whack-a-Mole).
iii. Consistency in UI/UX honesty across games with smooth/continuous transitions.
iv. Score board or results displayed for all games.
v. Responsive to desktop and mobile layouts.


Out of Scope for Now:
- Persistent data storage (i.e., keeping track of scores in each session).
- User log in / authentication.
- Multiplayer or online real-time play.


2. Milestones & Timeline

Sprint Kickoff (Planning):
i. Nail down which games will be created, and who is responsible for coding.
ii. Set up GitHub repository, base file structure.
iii. By the "Game Structure with Copilot" Session:
iv. Have the logic for one of the games (i.e., Rock Paper Scissors) executed with some help from Copilot.
v. Basic UI layout of at least one of the games is prepared.


By the "Mid-Sprint Demo + Feedback" Session:
i. Two games are functional with basic styling and working logic.
ii. Completed navigation between the landing page and games.
iii. Have internal play tests, and fix some basic bugs.


By the conclusion of Sprint End:
i. The final version deployed using Github Pages or Netlify
ii. Each game has been fully tested and styled
iii. A further third game included if there were ample time
iv. The documentation and a brief walkthrough of the project has been prepared


3. Team Roles and Responsibilities

Varsha:

- Leading the development and structuring of the Rock Paper Scissors game
- Will implement UI consistency and shared CSS styling across each game

Jessica:
- Will lead the design and implementation of game logic of Tic Tac Toe
- Will ensure that the game is mobile responsive

Tejas:
- Will lead the development of Whack-a-Mole as well as time, scoring and another feature
- Will assist in technical debugging and javascript logic across the other games

Jeevan:
- Will lead the design and build of the landing page
- Then will bring together all games to consolidate into one arcade and finalize navigation


Teamwork Strategy:
i. Individual primary responsibilities but we can help each other when possible
ii. Daily stand-ups (a brief sync-up with the team) to share our progress
iii. Use Github pull requests and also WhatsApp group to help facilitate our commitments


4. Challenges and Planned Strategies

Anticipated Challenges:
- Blending in differing styles and code structures to one seamless experience
- Managing time and meeting project deadlines
- Making sure that all games are working correctly and testing them across devices


Planned Strategies:
- Take control of neat, modular code and follow a common folder structure.
- Test each functionality in a timely manner, after you have coded that feature.
- Support any member who is inactive, or blocked if they need assistance.
- Stick to GitHub workflow (branches, pull requests, reviews) for cleaner collaboration.
